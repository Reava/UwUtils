# üß∞ Reava_'s Udon UwUtils Toolkit

* You'll find all sorts of niche scripts made in U# by myself for different projects, revisited & cleaned for everyone's use.
* This Toolkit is made to use simple scripts in unison to create more in specific behaviors rather than highly specific or overengineered scripts!
* By all means you are very welcome to pick and choose parts of my code to make your own scripts! These serve as a handy toolbox for everyone either for using directly in projects or to grow into new scripts of their own.

**Info**: There are currently 31 Udon Scripts in UwUtils! This will continue to expand as I find more ideas.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Tips**: 
- You can easily add any of my scripts by simply typing it in the component window instead of adding a Udon behaviour first!
- A lot of my scripts work best when used with other UwUtils scripts, you can do a LOT by combining their efforts!
- A lot of variables have tooltips you can hover over to get more insight
- My scripts output proper errors and logs, you can search for "*Reava_/UwUtils/*" in your logs/console to see any issues or find more insight about their behaviour.
- If you find any issues, need support or think of a script you'd like to see, you can join my **[Discord](https://discord.gg/TxYwUFKbUS)** or open an issue on Github!

## üìã **Script list**
<details>
<Summary>Expand me!</summary>
- **[Player Teleporter](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/PlayerTeleporter.cs)**:
Literally just TPs you on interact, that's it.
- **[Objects Toggle](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/ObjectsToggle.cs)**:
Toggles the state of an array of GameObjects & is persistence ready!
- **[Object State Setter](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/ObjectStateSetter.cs)**:
On interact, sets the state of an array of gameObjects. Does NOT revert once triggered again, it SETS the state and is NOT synced. (Events: _Invert to do the opposite, _Switch to swap all states)
- **[Tag Assigner](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/TagAssigner.cs)**:
Functions as a whitelist with functions, assigns a Tag to anyone who matches their username to the user Array of the behavior on world join. Local, allows toggling specific objects if user matches. Has a toggle to empower the user if they just created the instance regardless of whitelist matching. Supports adding users on the go and loading a remote string for updating the whitelist without updating the world!
- **[Tag TP](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/TagTP.cs)**:
If you got the correct Tag to your name on interact with the behavior, teleports you to the target, if not, teleports you to the second target (or doesn't if empty / disabled)
- **[ReflectionProbeController](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/ReflectionProbeController.cs)**:
RelfectionProbes are cool! make them real time, scripted and add this script to change the frequency they refresh at ! Use ToggleLoop() to toggle if it refreshes in a loop or stops until enabled again
- **[Spinny](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/Spinny.cs)**:
A script to rotate things on any axis, at any speed, and even at weird update speeds (like 30 degrees but only once a second). You should do that with animators, but this might be useful idk.
- **[Unity Fog Toggle](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/UnityFogToggle.cs)**:
Just an interact toggle that toggles ON/OFF Unity's fog... that's it. Call it with a trigger or a UI button, it'll work.
- **[Scene Initializer](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/SceneInitializer.cs)**:
Want to have things enabled for the first few seconds an user enters your world then disable ? the opposite ? both ? Just use that, ezpz
- **[tag Setter](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/tagSetter.cs)**:
Set a pre determined tag to the local user on interact. that's it.
- **[Tag Debugger](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/TagDebugger.cs)**:
Handy tool to display the local user's tag and output it to the debugLogs or text (Compatible with UnityUI, TMP & TMP GUI), updates on Interact & on Start.
- **[Tag Array TP](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/TagArrayTP.cs)**:
Have a lot of tags & want each one to TP the user to a different spot ? Well... this does it all for ya! Even has a fallback target when the user doesn't have a tag (can be disabled to disallow TPing when no matching ranks are found)
- **[Event Relay](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/EventRelay.cs)**:
Wanna use a button to push another button ? Do the same as UI can do ? Yup, just type the event name (like "\_interact"), if you want a delay or not & for how many seconds.... and you're good to go! You can also check the state of another object to ignore the delay if that object is on / off. Will support UdonBehavior Arrays on for the UdonSharp1.0 update soon
- **[Udon Keybinds](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/UdonKeybinds.cs)**:
Send an event call to 6 different udon behaviors based on keybinds, serves either for RollTheRed's Camera System or as a code template. Press CTRL + 1 to 6 to trigger changes. CTRL + 0 to toggle keybinds ON/OFF, defaults to ON unless changed. Will support UdonBehavior Arrays on for the UdonSharp1.0 update soon
- **[Animator Driver](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/AnimatorDriver.cs)**:
Inverts a boolean on an animator on interact... and that's it (Persistence ready!)
- **[Trigger Zone Relay](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/TriggerZoneRelay.cs)**:
Assign trigger colliders, and assign an Udon Behavior to send an event to either on Enter or Exit, super simple stuff! Supports UdonBehaviorArrays for U# 1.x version of the scripts.
- **[Playercount To Animator](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/PlayercountToAnimator.cs)**:
Enables driving an Animator's parameter (one parameter per Behavior, multiple Animators at once supported) between two values (Min/Max) depending on the player count in the instance. Can set the player count cap to reach max value.
- **[Join Bell](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/JoinBell.cs)**:
Pretty straightforward, just tap in an AudioSource & a clip for Join/Leave and enjoy (bell sound can be toggled by UI or eventRelay using "_JoinToggle" event)
- **[Toggle Canvas](https://github.com/Reava/ReavaUwUtils/blob/main/Runtime/Scripts/ToggleCanvas.cs)**:
